# The App
We created this app so that they could log their transactions in a more convenient and efficient manner.
Previously, they logged financials on paper.

* Accepting donations on the app
* Data analytics for their finances
* Get remote database support so that anyone can log, anytime, anywhere, with defined permissions
* And much more.
